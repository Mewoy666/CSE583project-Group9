        The movie industry has witnessed its prosperity for the last two decades.There are new movies produced everyday and we now have more film choices than ever before. However, it also becomes hard to tell if one movie is better than the other. So we want to create a movie recommender system to help our users pick the right high-quality movie that’s in their favors.

        Our dataset contains 5 main files:
